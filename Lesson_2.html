				<p>Investing is not just about stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Investing includes many things such as repairs on the house, college, retirement and so on.</p>

				<h3>The Concept of Money</h3>
				<p>Time is the only true resource we have. <strong>It's the only asset you truly own.</strong> Whether you're Bill Gates or an average Joe, you only have a life expectancy of 78 year's worth of time.</p>

				<p>Money, then, is nothing more than a claim on somebody else's time. You can take money and pay somebody to make you some food at a restaurant.</p>

				<p>Money allows us to convert our time into a medium of exchange that is universally accepted wherever we go. This allows for a more efficient economy as we can just convert our time into money and then spend that money on whatever goods and services we want, as money is universally accepted everywhere by everybody (thereby avoiding a barter system TMI).</p>

				<h3>Time, Money and How it relates to Investing.</h3>

				<p>The point of investing is to invest your money in an operation now so that, that particular operation grows over time and provides you with additional money. And what is money? <strong>A tool that lets you exchange/use someone else's time. </strong></p>

				<h3><EM>Chapter 2: </EM>THE POWER OF COMPOUNDING</h3>

				<p>There are many variables that determine how much your money/investment will grow. But the most important variable of all is <strong>Time.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Some statistics show that $200 invested 40 years ago would have resulted in $200,000 today.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Compound Interest is not only the return on your principal but also on the interest.</strong></p>

				<p>Another Example: A penny since 0 AD with 1% interest rate annually will result in almost $5 million today. Take a look at the following chart.</p>

				<h3>The 25 year old and the 40 year old procrastinator</h3>

				<p>Given historical results of the s&p500, to get $1000,000 by the age of 65, a 25 year old would only need to invest less than $100 per month compared to a 40 year old who would need to invest almost $600 per month.</p>

				<p>The moral of the story? <strong>START INVESTING NOW!</strong> The earlier you start, the better.</p>

				<h3><em>Chapter 3:</em>RETIREMENT</h3>

				<p>Back in the days, retirement meant you just stopped working. There were no taxes before 1913 as well. <strong>But today's story is not the same.</strong></p>

				<p>You can expect to pay about <strong>22%</strong> in federal income taxes and any where from <strong>0%</strong> to <strong>15%</strong> in state income taxes. Also back in the days, you could have relied on your 5 kids and lived off of them and society was ok with that. These days, that's not how the society works. </p>

				<p>That's why it is very important that you start investing now. Because when you're 65, that's the time when you are prone to diseases and most financially vulnerable.</p>

				<p>Investing for retirement is for a time in your life that is arguably going to be the best of your life, as you will no longer have to work. So why not do it right?</p>

				<p>The US social security system is a bad example of investing. Well, it's not really an investing. The government is taking th mony and then immediately spending it. Where is the opportunity for investing....?</p>

				<p>The stock market returns a historical 12.83%, however, social security has been estimated to only provide a paltry 2% annualized return.</p>

				<p>The problem worsens because of our demographics. In 1950, there were 16 contributors for every recipient but now there are only 3.1 and in the future it will be only <strong>2!!!</strong></p>

				<h3>Final Words on Retirement</h3>

				<p>The sad truth of retiring plan is that it isn't easy. It involves number crunching, guess work, budgeting, discussion with your loved ones and a regimental schedule of investing. That's why so many people procrastinate or never start investing for retirement.</p>

				<p>And remember to always be <strong>conservative!!!</strong> A $3 million retirement for someone else might not work for you because different people have different medical needs, interests, life style and so on. </p>

				<h3><em>Chapter 4: </em> COLLEGE</h3>

				<p>While retirement is the largest and perhaps the most important reason to invest, there are other investments that are incredibly important and can be afforded by the use of investing, college being one of them.</p>

				<p>College is important as it directly affects how much money you make. And the more money you make, the more you earn.</p>

				<p>Ultimately, if you are educated, then your net worth goes up automatically. Knowledge is power.</p>


				<p>The overall lesson to learn about inveting for college is that it is a tough investment to make mainly because there is so little time to prepare for college. So for a parent, the best way is to start a college fund for their kids at the birth.</p>

				<h3><em>Chapter 5: </em>HOUSING</h3>

				<p>After college, but before you retire, you're probably going to want to buy a house. A house is usually a person's largest single asset and investment. However, it is not so easy. You need to save up for down payment, unless you have really good credit scores, then you might be able to do it without.</p>

				<p>It also depends on what kind of house you want to buy as well as where do you want to buy the house. In the middle of North Dakota, land is cheap and your average house may cost $40000. But, go to downtown San Francisco, and two square feet of land will cost you a fortune.</p>

				<p>Saving up for down payment is not an easy thing to do. 10% of a $300,000 is $30,000. And since housing prices go up in time, your dream house that costed $300,000 might have gone to $500,000 in 5 years.</p>

				<p>But fear not, you can do this with a roth IRA!!!</p>
