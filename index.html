				<p>Investing is not just about stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Investing includes many things such as repairs on the house, college, retirement and so on.</p>

				<h3>The Concept of Money</h3>
				<p>Time is the only true resource we have. <strong>It's the only asset you truly own.</strong> Whether you're Bill Gates or an average Joe, you only have a life expectancy of 78 year's worth of time.</p>

				<p>Money, then, is nothing more than a claim on somebody else's time. You can take money and pay somebody to make you some food at a restaurant.</p>

				<p>Money allows us to convert our time into a medium of exchange that is universally accepted wherever we go. This allows for a more efficient economy as we can just convert our time into money and then spend that money on whatever goods and services we want, as money is universally accepted everywhere by everybody (thereby avoiding a barter system TMI).</p>

				<h3>Time, Money and How it relates to Investing.</h3>

				<p>The point of investing is to invest your money in an operation now so that, that particular operation grows over time and provides you with additional money. And what is money? <strong>A tool that lets you exchange/use someone else's time. </strong></p>

				<h3>The Power Of Compounding</h3>

				<p>There are many variables that determine how much your money/investment will grow. But the most important variable of all is <strong>Time.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Some statistics show that $200 invested 40 years ago would have resulted in $200,000 today.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Compound Interest is not only the return on your principal but also on the interest.</strong></p>

				<p>Another Example: A penny since 0 AD with 1% interest rate annually will result in almost $5 million today. Take a look at the following chart.</p>

				<h3>The 25 year old and the 40 year old procrastinator</h3>

				<p>Given historical results of the s&p500, to get $1000,000 by the age of 65, a 25 year old would only need to invest less than $100 per month compared to a 40 year old who would need to invest almost $600 per month.</p>
