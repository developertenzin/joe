				<h3><em>Chapter 1: </em> INTRO </h3>

				<p>In lesson 1, you learned that options can be incredibly versatile, and they can improve the performance of almost any investment portfolio.</p>

				<p>With options, you have leverage. By leverage, I mean the <strong>the ability of a small investment to make a large return or profit.</strong> Options can reward the investor anywhere from five to 10 times more than buying a stock.</p>

				<p>Let's get into the technical parts. Each option has a symbol which helps you identify what option you're buying or selling. It's easy but takes some time to get used to.</p>

				<p><strong>Note: Options aren't some sort of get-rich-quick scheme, nor do they guarantee riches at all. It's possible to make a lot of money, may be a fortune overnight or within a week. But it were that easy, everyone would be doing it.</strong></p>

				<h3><em>Chapter 2: </em>Option Terminology</h3>
				<p>There are two types of options. The first is called a <em><strong>call</strong></em> and the other is called a <em><strong>put.</strong></em></p>

				<p>The call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a specific price for a specified time.</p>

				<p>The put option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a specific price for a specified time.</p>

				<p>For now, we'll focus on call options only. Later, you can apply almost everything to put options.</p>
				<p>In Lesson 1, you learned the four elements common to all options:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An underlying stock</li>
					<li>The right to buy or sell the stock</li>
					<li>A specified price</li>
					<li>A fixed time period</li>
				</ul>

				<strong>What is the underlying stock?</strong>: The main company stock
				<br><br>

				<strong>Right to Buy or Sell Stock</strong>
				The right to buy the stock is the call option, and the right to sell the stock is the put option.

				<p>Okay, so when you purchase an IBM call option, you purchase the right to buy IBM stock. But how much stock do you have the right to buy? The answer is 100 shares of IBM. <strong>Important: one option equals 100 shares.</strong></p>

				<strong>Purchase Price:</strong>
				<p>The specified purchase price for the stock is the strike price, and sometimes it's called the exercise price. You can't buy options to purchase or sell a stock for just any old price. Options are only offered to purchase an underlying stock at certain strike prices.</p>

				<p>Let's say IBM stock is trading at $97 per share. If I look up the available options on IBM, I see they have strike prices of $85, $90, $95, $100, and maybe $105. There's no option to buy IBM at $97. The closest option available, by standardized rules, is the $95 option.

				Let's say you decide to purchase one IBM $95 call option. You then have the right to buy 100 shares of IBM stock at $95. Remember, one option equals 100 shares of the underlying stock. Using option terminology, you'd say you've purchased an IBM 95 call.</p>

				<strong>Time Period: </strong> Remember! All options have a dead line. If you loop up options for a stock right now, you might see different options for different month dead line. A July call option will expire in july. And it's usually the 3rd Friday of the month. So In option terminology, you would say XYZ June2016 $$ call.<br><br>

				<h3><em>Chapter 3: </em> Option Symbology</h3>

				<p>We know that each stock has its own symbol. For example, Google is goog, Internationa business machines is IBM, Microsoft is MSFT and so on. However, each stock can have many different options. That's why options have their own way of representation.</p>

				<p>Option symbols are 21 characters. It inclues stock-ticker symbol, year, month, day, call/put indicator, strike dollar, strike Decimal.</p>

				<p>For example, for <strong>GOOG150619C00570000</strong></p>

				<p>The first four letters is the stock ticker symbol for Google. "15" is the year. "06" is the month june. "19" is the day. "C" stands for call.. if it was "P", it would be put. And the strike price is $570.</p>
